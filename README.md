Assignment 5 for ISQA 8380.  This application takes a Django Web framework and utilizes the Django Rest Framework and a Vue.js frontend.  
The core Application is a travel search aggreation service. The site will present users with a clean simple UI with a Search Bar.  The search bar will request a user to input a City name (e.g. Omaha).  The service will then aggregate multiple tools into a single panel about the city in order to give users a single pane of glass about that location.  It can be used to help determine users' decision to make a trip to that city.
